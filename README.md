Repository for MPRA analysis method "MPRAudit"

## Functions:
Function "return_counts" takes as input several experimental parameters (number of clones, amount of noise, etc), and returns as output RNA counts, DNA counts, and variables proportional to the number of counts of RNA and DNA (which may be useful for normalization).
Function "deleteDjackknife_variance_T0" calculates the technical variance for a given sequence segment.
